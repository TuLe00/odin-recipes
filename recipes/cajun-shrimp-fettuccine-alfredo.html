    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt-free Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>5 ounces large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely grated garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted chicken stock</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup light whipping cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine according to package directions until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, 
            7 to 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Pat shrimp dry, add to the bowl, and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When butter bubbles, add shrimp and cook until opaque and pink, about 2 minutes per side. 
            Transfer shrimp to a clean bowl. Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth to the skillet and scrape up any brown bits.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Season broth with white pepper and red pepper flakes. Slowly whisk in cream and continue cooking for 2 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese slowly, 
            whisking constantly. Cook until sauce has thickened, 2 minutes more. Return shrimp to the skillet, add pasta, and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Add reserved cooking water 1 tablespoon at a time, if sauce is too thick. Season with salt to taste. Serve sprinkled with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
